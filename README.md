## What it is
The aim of this project is to create an eco-first garden planner. The rest of it is still in progress ☺️

## Development
To run the project correctly, download the [Live Server](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ritwickdey.LiveServer) extension to VSCode, or open another server yourself. In other cases, the CORS policy stops the 3D models from working.
